justifies.

## Producer output

Justifies the bound defaults (`design-docs/analysis.md` § Bounds).

| Output | Bytes | Gzipped | Results | Rules | Most places per result | Most flow steps per result | Largest property bag | Deepest nesting |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CodeQL 2.15.0, C++ queries over a small interpreter | 226,586 | 22,398 | 22 | 165 | 2 | 0 | 9 | 11 |
| CodeQL 2.2.5, Java queries | 111,783 | 6,439 | 15 | 25 | 4 | 12 | 7 | 14 |
| clang 18.1.3 static analyzer, one unit | 12,899 | 1,284 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 5 | none | 14 |
| cppcheck 2.22.0, two units | 6,182 | 853 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 9 |
| clang-tidy through `clang-tidy-sarif` | 751 | 328 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | none | 9 |

The Java output is `samples/sarif/java/detailed/java.sarif` in
github.com/peter-murray/github-security-report-action at commit `84b2945`; the
others are the reader's fixtures, whose origins are recorded beside them.

| Reading | |
|---|---|
| Compression | Every output of 5 KB or more compressed 7 to 17 times, so a gzipped upload meets the decompressed bound well before the bound as sent |
| Size per result | CodeQL's was largest, about 10 KB a result, mostly the description of every query it ran |
| Snippets | None of them carries one |
